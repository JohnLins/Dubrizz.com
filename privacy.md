**Privacy Policy for Dubrizz**

*Last updated: 11/13/24*

Dubrizz ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information we collect, how we use it, and the measures we take to ensure your privacy is respected. By using Dubrizz, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this policy.

### 1. Information We Collect

Dubrizz collects user input, including conversation history and interaction details, to enhance and improve our services. Information provided by users may be used to train and fine-tune our language models, optimize our responses, and analyze user trends.

### 2. Use of User Input for Model Training and Improvement

By using Dubrizz, you consent to the use of your input for purposes of improving our language model. This includes using input data to train or fine-tune our models, except when the conversation history contains highly sensitive or unsafe personal information. If an internal prompt determines that the input is sensitive or unsafe, it will not be used for these purposes.

Additionally, Dubrizz may sell user input data for model training and improvement, provided that the prompt, "the conversation history includes highly sensitive or unsafe personal information," returns a result of False, indicating that the input does not include such information.

### 3. Consent and Shared Conversations

If the input you provide contains any conversation or information involving another individual, you must have the explicit consent of that individual before submitting it to Dubrizz for processing. This ensures compliance with privacy standards and respects the confidentiality of third parties.

### 4. Security and Storage

We take the security of your information seriously and implement reasonable measures to protect it. Dubrizz uses industry-standard practices to safeguard input data, both during transmission and once received. However, no method of transmission or storage is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of your data.


### 6. Legal Requirements

Dubrizz operates under applicable laws and regulations. The founders of Dubrizz are based in California, but the company is not registered as a legal entity. Dubrizz is committed to compliance with relevant data protection and privacy laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) where applicable.

### 7. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you by posting the revised policy on our website and updating the date at the top of the page. Your continued use of Dubrizz after the posting of any modifications constitutes your acceptance of the updated terms.



**By using Dubrizz, you confirm that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy.**
